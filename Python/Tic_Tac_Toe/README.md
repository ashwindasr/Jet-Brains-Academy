# Hangman
## About
Games can help you kill time when you’re bored. But before smartphones, people played games the classic way – with paper and pencil. Let’s recreate one such game and improve your programming skills in the process. In this project, you will code Hangman, a game where the player has to guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited number of attempts. Make a program that plays Hangman with you – and good luck with the guessing!
## Learning outcomes
Best project for Python Basics: uses functions, loops, lists, and other variables. The Random module is a cherry on top. Don’t be intimidated by the number of stages – they ensure that your immersion in Python is smooth and safe.
## Project
###  [Stage 1/8: Hello, Hangman][1]
Write a program that puts basic information on the screen: give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing! 
###  [Stage 2/8: I want to play a game][2]
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee. 
### [Stage 3/8: Make your choice][3]
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter. 
### [Stage 4/8: Help is on the way][4]
Upgrade your knowledge of functions – set the machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee. 
### [Stage 5/8: Keep trying][5]
Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”. 
### [Stage 6/8: The value of life][6]
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly. 
### [Stage 7/8: Error!][7]
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly. 
### [Stage 8/8: Menu, please][8]
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.

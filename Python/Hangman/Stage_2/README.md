#  I want to play a game
## Description
At this stage, you will create a real game. It will be simple, but there will be two possible outcomes (you can see in the examples below how they look like). Let's first print a welcome message and then ask a player to guess the word we set for the game. If our player manages to guess the exact word, the game reports "win"; otherwise it will "hang" the player.

## Objective
   1. Ask a player for a possible word.
   2. Print ```You survived!``` if the user guessed the word.
   3. Print ```You are hanged!``` if the user haven't guessed the word

By the way, the word ```python``` should be the correct word to win the game.
## Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by space (```> ```) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.
##### Example 1
```
H A N G M A N
Guess the word: > python
You survived!
```
##### Example 2
```
H A N G M A N
Guess the word: > java
You are hanged!
```

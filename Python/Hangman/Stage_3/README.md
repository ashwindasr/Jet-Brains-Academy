#   Make your choice
## Description
If there is a predefined word, the game isn't replayable: you already know the word, so it makes no sense to guess it. At this stage, let's make the game more challenging by choosing a word from a special list with a variety of options. This way, our game won't be just a one-time entertainment.

## Objective
    
   1. Create the following word list: ```'python', 'java', 'kotlin', 'javascript'```.
   2. Program the game to choose a random word from it. You can enter more words, but let's stick to these four for now.

## Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by space (```> ```) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.##### 

Example 1:  *the computer randomly chose ```python``` from the list.*
```
H A N G M A N
Guess the word: > python
You survived!
```
Example 2: *the computer randomly chose something other than ```python``` from the list.*
```
H A N G M A N
Guess the word: > python
You are hanged!
```
Example 3: *the computer randomly chose something other than ```kotlin``` from the list.*
```
H A N G M A N
Guess the word: > kotlin
You are hanged!
```

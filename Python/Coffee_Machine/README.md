# Coffee Machine
## About
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
## Learning outcomes
This project allows you to get a taste of Python. Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Python.
## Project
###  [Stage 1/6: Hello, coffee!][1]
Write a program that puts basic information on the screen: give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing! 
###  [Stage 2/6: Machines have needs][2]
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee. 
### [Stage 3/6: Enough coffee for everyone][3]
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter. 
### [Stage 4/6: Action][4]
Upgrade your knowledge of functions – set the machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee. 
### [Stage 5/6: On a coffee loop][5]
Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”. 
### [Stage 6/6: Brush your code][6]
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.

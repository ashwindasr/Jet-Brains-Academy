### Projects
#### 1. [Coffee Machine](https://github.com/ashwindasr/Jet-Brains-Academy/tree/master/Python/Coffee_Machine)
 This project allows you to get a taste of Python. Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Python.

#### 2. [Hangman](https://github.com/ashwindasr/Jet-Brains-Academy/tree/master/Python/Hangman)
 Best project for Python Basics: uses functions, loops, lists, and other variables. The Random module is a cherry on top. Don’t be intimidated by the number of stages – they ensure that your immersion in Python is smooth and safe.

#### 2. [Hangman](https://github.com/ashwindasr/Jet-Brains-Academy/tree/master/Python/Tic-Tac-Toe)
Games can help you kill time when you’re bored. But before smartphones, people played games the classic way – with paper and pencil. Let’s recreate one such game and improve your programming skills in the process. In this project, you will code Hangman, a game where the player has to guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited number of attempts. Make a program that plays Hangman with you – and good luck with the guessing!

# Endless care <3

## Description
Time to bring our project to an option that will be convenient and understandable. At the final stage, your software will be ready for use by the zoo staff. Your program should understand the habitat numbers, show the animals and be able to work infinitely
## Objective
Your tasks at this point:

   1. Your program should repeat the behavior from the previous stage, but now in a loop.
   2. Do not forget to add an exit opportunity for the program: inputting a word ```exit``` must terminate the program.
   3. At the end of the execution it must print: ``See you!```.

## Example
The example The greater-than symbol followed by space (```> ```) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.
Final software must work this way: shows how your output might look.
##### Output:
